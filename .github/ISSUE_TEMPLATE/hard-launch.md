Congrats, @______! Your project is officially ready for hard launch.

Hard launch means the project is ready to be marketed to our students, which also means you will receive your prepayment. I've notified our accounting department who usually process the payment within the next week. Please contact accounting@datacamp.com if you have any questions.

Email, social, etc. marketing is scheduled for MONTH DAY. You'll get a big bump in completions upon that launch so you may wish to revisit the content quality dashboard to ensure everything is as you wish prior to that. :)

Congrats, once again! ðŸŽ‰
